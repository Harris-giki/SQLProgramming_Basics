# SQLProgramming_Basics

This repository is a personal collection of SQL scripts that I wrote and practiced to build a strong foundation in relational database concepts. It includes both basic and advanced SQL operations using PostgreSQL and PL/pgSQL.

> üß† The purpose of this repository is to reinforce core SQL logic through hands-on experimentation with queries, constraints, views, triggers, joins, and more.

## üìÅ What's Inside

Here‚Äôs a quick overview of some of the SQL concepts covered:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Database_Setup.sql` | Creating and initializing sample databases and tables |
| `Clauses.sql` | Practicing WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and HAVING clauses |
| `constraints_part1.sql` | Exploring PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK, and NOT NULL constraints |
| `joins.sql` | INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN examples |
| `subqueries_joins.sql` | Nested queries and combined JOIN operations |
| `where-delete-truncate-drop.sql` | Practicing deletion and cleanup commands |
| `View.sql` | Creating and querying database views |
| `Triggers.sql` | Sample triggers to automate tasks on data change |
| `PL-PG-SQL-Basics.sql` | Fundamentals of procedural SQL (PL/pgSQL) |
| `cursors_functions_procedures.sql` | Working with stored procedures, functions, and cursors |

## üíª How to Use

1. Clone this repo or download individual `.sql` files.
2. Open a PostgreSQL client (e.g., pgAdmin, DBeaver, or psql).
3. Run the script in a database of your choice.
4. Observe results and modify the queries for deeper understanding.
